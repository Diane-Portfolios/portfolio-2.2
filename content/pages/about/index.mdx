# About

Nice to meet you! I'm Diane, a software developer from Seattle, WA. 
I graduated from Indiana University with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications.
I've spent the last 10 years working various positions in hospitality, including bartending and 
events management. I'm also a personal trainer and group fitness instructor.

After moving to Seattle in 2014, I spent a few years thinking about getting into tech. 
I didn't fully understand what software development was, and I wasn't sure if I'd be good at it...
My only coding experience was from MySpace circa 2006. When the Covid lockdown began in 2020,
I lost my bartending job. I decided to enroll in the Code Fellows program. In January 2021,
I finished the program as a full stack JavaScript developer. I have since taken an interest in
Cybersecurity and DevOps, and have begun learning Python and penetration testing.
