This was my final group project in the Code Fellows program; we created a React app of 
Munchkin, the tabletop card game from Steve Jackson. The game allows each user to create 
an account, and their login credentials are stored in a database. Users can start their own game room 
or join an existing room, where they can play Munchkin with other players.
